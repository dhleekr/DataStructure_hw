    "The key idea for the variable-length codes is as follows: For every letter in $\\texttt{A = {a, b, c, d, e, f}}$, we assign a string of bits. For example, we may assign $\\texttt{'01001'}$ to $\\texttt{'a'}$, $\\texttt{'100'}$ to $\\texttt{'d'}$ and so on. $\\texttt{'dad'}$ would then be encoded as $\\texttt{'10001001100'}$. In order to decode variable-length code, a $\\texttt{'prefix'}$ code is typically used for encoding. Let us understand prefix codes with a counter example. Let there be four characters $\\texttt{'a'}$, $\\texttt{'b'}$, $\\texttt{'c'}$ and $\\texttt{'d'}$, and the corresponding variable length codes be $\\texttt{'00'}$, $\\texttt{'01'}$, $\\texttt{'0'}$ and $\\texttt{'1'}$. This coding, however, is problematic, because the code for $\\texttt{'c'}$ corresponds to the prefix of codes for $\\texttt{'a'}$ and $\\texttt{'b'}$. If the encoded bit stream is $\\texttt{'0001'}$, the decoded output may be $\\texttt{'cccd'}$ or $\\texttt{'ccb'}$ or $\\texttt{'acd'}$ or $\\texttt{'ab'}$. That is, it is hard to determine the boundaries between characters. To prevent this, one requirement is that any encoded code cannot be used for the prefix for other ones.  "

We can obtain the code for each character by following a path from the root to the leaf. For example, the Huffman codes for the characters {a, b, c, d, e, f} are obtained with the Huffman tree as follows: "
